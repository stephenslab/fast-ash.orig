# fast-ash

The goal of this repo is to look at methods for making ashr run faster, possibly at cost of accuracy. 
Motivation is particularly for 
large data sets and when ash is used repeatedly as part of an iterative method (so each application of ash does not
necessarily need to run to convergence).
